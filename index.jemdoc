== Short Biography 

- Since Mid-September 2023, I have been a  tenure-track assistant professor at Radboud University. As a member of the multi-institude consortium DBI2, backed by a substantial 10-year grant totaling 21.9M Euros, I do not have to teach in the initial 3 years. Thus, You may call me a /researcher/. 

- From Jan. 2020 to Jul. 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Riverside, advised by [http://www.fabiopas.it/index.html Prof. Fabio Pasqualetti].

- In Dec. 2019, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from University of Groningen. My advisor was [https://www.rug.nl/staff/m.cao/ Prof. Ming Cao]. 
- Before that, I did my master in Wuhan University, China. 




== Research Interests
My research mainly aims to develop brain-inspired efficient, adaptive, and autonomous learning and decision-making models. Toward this goal, I build network systems to reveal the fundamental principles underlying the brain's efficiency, adaptability, and autonomy in integrating and processing information from a lens of control theory and dynamical systems. As a complementary goal, I also leverage tractable control systems design to inform mechanistic and predictable therapeutics for neurological disorders.
